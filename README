README for CS50 Final Project
Team UvaRara: Shivang Sethi, Dana Silver, and Ellen Li

Editor: Sublime Text 2 & 3, Emacs
Tested on: stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu


Command line syntax: AM_Startup -d [DIFFICULTY] -n [AVATARS] -h [HOSTNAME]

To compile, call 'make'


Correct inputs:

[DIFFICULTY]: must be between 0 and 9, inclusive. The program will inform the user
and quit if the difficulty is not within this range.

[AVATARS]: must be between 1 and 10, inclusive. The program will inform the user and
quit if the number of avatars is not within this range.

[HOSTNAME]: must be a valid hostname. 


Output: 

As the maze is being solved, an ASCII representation is displayed to stdout,
showing the north and west walls on each cell, which correctly draws
all two way walls, and some of the one way walls inserted when an avatar
backtracks and blocks off a dead end.

A logfile that describes all the moves that the avatars have made in solving
the maze. The first line of the log file contains the MazePort, AvatarID, and
the date and time. The rest of the logfile contains all the moves that the
avatars made throughout the solving process.


Heuristic:

Our team implemented left hand rule with a few optimizations: 
    1. Kept track of known walls so as to prevent avatars from making incorrect
       moves more than once.
    2. Cut off dead ends whenever found, so that other avatars would not make the
       same mistake.
    3. Stored the border of the maze in our walls array immediately, so that the
       avatars never attempted to move outside of the maze bounds.
